As a recent graduate from the University of Wyoming with a degree in Geology, I am excited to begin my career in the field. My expertise includes geomorphology, petrology, sedimentology, and GIS. I have gained hands-on experience in data collection, analysis and interpretation during various field and laboratory research projects. Furthermore, I am proficient in using Python for data analysis and GIS technologies, which I have utilized to analyze large datasets and create detailed maps. These skills will allow me to contribute to the understanding and sustainable management of natural resources. I am eager to continue to develop my technical skills, and apply them to real-world projects.

In addition to my professional interests, I am also passionate about the outdoors. I enjoy hiking and backpacking, and have had the opportunity to explore some of the most beautiful wilderness areas in the country. I am also an avid mountain biker, and enjoy the thrill of exploring new trails. Photography is another hobby of mine, I love to capture the natural beauty of the landscapes I explore. Finally, I am also a traveler and love to explore new cultures and places. I believe that traveling broadens one's perspective and helps to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world we live in. These hobbies have not only given me a chance to explore the world and create memories but also have helped me to develop skills like problem solving, navigation, and adaptability.
